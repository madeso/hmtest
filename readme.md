# hmtest
Shader test from around early 2007, named after "heightmap" but contains no heightmaps

It used boost, devil and my own SDL (1) clone called SGL that I think is lost in time.
So I did what any sane person does when he finds a project from the dark ages... I ported it to windows/linx systems using std::shared_ptr, stb image and sdl2, so I could run it and see what it's doing.
Nothing really to write home about as it turns out.

Anyway, here it is. Enjoy.
